# low_level_calculator
The following code either converts one system of numbers into the others or does simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and remainder) between two numbers of the same system.


To run the code run the following command on the terminal:
python main.py {parameter 1} {parameter 2} {paremeter 3} {parameter 4}

parameter 1 -- 'c' for conversion or 'o' for operation

parameter 2 -- 'b' for binary or 'o' for octal or 'd' for decimal or 'h' for hexadecimal

parameter 3 --  the number (in its number system) which needs to be converted or to be put as an operand

parameter 4 --  (this parameter is given only when parameter 1 is 'o') the number (in its number system) which acts as an operand
